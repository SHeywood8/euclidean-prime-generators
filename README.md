# Euclidean Prime Generators
A GitHub Repository to showcase code used in claims in my University project on Euclidean Prime Generators.

The code will be structured into documents for each section in the project where code is utilised.

Most files will take the form of .ipynb files to allow for additional explanation if desired.

File `03.2-cycvals.csv` is a csv file that contains the values that the first $1000$ cyclotomic polynomials can take modulo $m$. In particular, the $m^{th}$ row contains the values gained by putting $x=0,1,2,...,m-1$ into $\Phi_m(x)$ and taking the modulus with respect to $m$.
